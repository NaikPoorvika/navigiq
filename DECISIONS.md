# NAVIGIQ ARCHITECTURAL DECISION RECORDS (DECISIONS.md)

## ADR-001: Single Workstation
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** The application is designed for ONE physical workstation (Intel Xeon W-2295, 128GB RAM, RTX A5000 24GB). Cloud APIs or distributed GPU setups will not be used.

## ADR-002: LLM is not authoritative
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** The LLM will only be used for orchestration, reasoning, and language generation. It is NOT the source of truth for coordinates, distances, routing, or budget calculations.

## ADR-003: Bounded Agentic AI
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** Agentic behavior is restricted. The agent must use strict typed tools to interact with deterministic services and must never execute arbitrary shell commands or SQL.

## ADR-004: Typed tool registry
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** All agentic capabilities will be exposed through a controlled registry of typed tools, preventing the fabrication of external requests or data.

## ADR-005: Deterministic planning core
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** All math, routing (OSRM), optimization (OR-Tools), and constraint validations are handled strictly by deterministic code, acting as the authoritative planner.

## ADR-006: Prefer modular monolith
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** The system will be built as a modular monolith. Separate containers are acceptable only where operationally justified (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis, OSRM, Ollama), avoiding unnecessary microservices.

## ADR-007: Metro removed
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-09-04

**Context:** NQ-020 built a static Namma Metro graph, since OSRM cannot route
transit — ~20 stations, Dijkstra, headway/2 wait, interchange penalties,
distance-band fares, plus a multi-modal arc builder.

**Measured outcome:** Metro lost every arc tested. Indiranagar to Lalbagh was
47 min by metro against ~25 by auto — 80–84% slower once access walk, headway
wait and the Majestic interchange are counted. A 3×3 matrix across Indiranagar,
MG Road and Lalbagh chose auto for all six arcs.

**Decision:** Remove metro entirely — graph module, four YAML data files, enum
values in the TripSpec schema and cost model, fare bands, arc-builder branch,
and the metro tests. Recoverable from git history.

**Consequences:** Users cannot request metro, and the planner will not silently
substitute another mode for it. NavigIQ has no public transit support; the
README must say so rather than leave it implied.

**Rejected:** Raising the arc-selection time tolerance until metro wins. That
would mean recommending routes taking twice as long to save ₹60.



## ADR-008: Prominence replaces POI ratings
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-09-03

**Context:** No free source of POI ratings exists. OpenStreetMap has none, and
commercial place APIs are excluded by ADR-001.

**Decision:** Rank on a deterministic prominence score computed from Wikidata
presence, Wikipedia presence, tag richness and a curated landmark flag. Store
the component breakdown so any ranking can be explained.

**Consequences:** Prominence measures documentation and notability, not quality
— no star ratings may ever be displayed. Measured distribution across 14,851
POIs: 9,705 score 0.000, ~94% below 0.06, only 60 above 0.3. Its ranking weight
was therefore reduced from 0.20 to 0.10 and the difference moved to proximity
and diversity. Curated POIs carry an editorial score that overrides it.

## ADR-009: Widened coordinate bounds
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-09-04

**Context:** The draft TripSpec bounding box (lat 12.6–13.3) would have rejected
Nandi Hills at 13.37, a genuine day-trip destination inside the OSM extract.

**Decision:** Widen to lat 11.9–13.75, lon 76.7–78.9, matching the extract.

**Consequences:** The bbox guard catches coordinates hallucinated in another
country, not trips outside the city centre. Trip radius is controlled by
radius_km and the feasibility engine, not by this guard.


## ADR-010: Deterministic solving over search breadth
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-09-04

**Context:** CP-SAT with parallel workers is non-deterministic even with a
fixed seed — workers race and objective ties break by whichever finishes
first. The same TripSpec produced different stop orders across runs, making
plan reproducibility meaningless.

**Measured (NQ-023 benchmark):** single worker reaches optimal at N=10
(1.6 s) and N=20 (5.1 s), and times out at N=35 and N=50. Eight workers are
roughly 3x faster below N=20 but also time out at 35 and 50. Parallelism
buys speed, not optimality, at the sizes that matter.

**Decision:** one search worker, fixed seed, candidate cap reduced from 50
to 20.

**Consequences:** Every solve is reproducible and provably optimal within its
candidate set. The optimizer chooses from the 20 best-ranked POIs rather than
50. If the cap is ever raised, the time limit must rise with it and
determinism must be re-verified.
